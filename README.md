# FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS

I analysed financial transactions over an year for an individual in the period of march 2023- march 2024 
# Problem: 
The individual was unable to correctly determine whether they are using their money(money out) in the right way based on their income (money in)
# Solution: 
I used python and its libraries to give results of money in, money out and ledgers progress both visually and non-visually.
# Data interpretation: 
58% of what made it to the account was used and 42% is what is remaining.
There was no month that money out significantly exceeded money in.
There were indeed very high peaks of money in and money out. (which the individual may want to put into account based on how they are using the money and what they are using it for)
# Conclusion
2024 has definitely seen a lot of money out so far as compared with money in, again while comparing with 2023.
The conclusion excluding other financial factors is that the usage is okay.Although they can work toward a 50-50 money in and money out and remove any bias.

--WE WILL DEFINITELY KEEP MONITORING THEIR TRANSACTIONS TO KEEP THEM ON CHECK AND OFFER BETTER FEEDBACK
